What is OSAI?

OSAI or Old School Artificial Intelligence is a project of mine that sprouted based off of my love for coding and Runescape. 

OSAI's goal is an attempt to bring artificial Intelligence into Old School Runescape to predict what type of gear is needed for each monster Runescape. 
This project was made to train and test my skills with web-based programming as well as AI-based programming. 

OSAI is built using flask to support the website infrastructure 


Currently completed:
User Authentication (Signin/signout/sessionManagement)
Interfacing with OsrsDB to obtain Runescape data see: (https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db)

In Progress:
User Navigation
AI Algorithm
User interfacing with OSRSDB and displaying item statistics 

Usage: 
  future usage of this project is hopefully projected at all users that play runescape, using this website as an extra ability to get an idea of what gear should be used at each monster in the game. 
  
License: 
  I am still new and have no went into much understanding of Licenses yet. I do not expect anything in this project to have a large monitary value since it is just based off of a video game with alot of data.
