What is OSAI?

OSAI or Old School Artificial Intelligence is a project of mine that sprouted based off of my love for coding and Runescape. 

OSAI's goal is an attempt to bring artificial Intelligence into Old School Runescape to predict what type of gear is needed for each monster in Runescape. 
This project was made to train and test my skills with web-based programming as well as AI-based programming. 

OSAI is built using flask to support the website infrastructure 
How the Algorithm will be built is still a work in progress i am expecting to usee scikit learn and other python packages such as tensorflow. 

Currently completed:

User Authentication (Signin/signout/sessionManagement),
Interfacing with OsrsDB to obtain Runescape data see: (https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db),
Referencing Jinja2 rednered code to create dynamic pages based off of a template,
Hashing User Passwords,
Creating a Base Css tempalte to visualize and understand website layout,
Reading and wrtiting to a MYSQL database without any errors or discrepensies in the database,


In Progress:

User Navigation,
AI Algorithm,
User interfacing with OSRSDB and displaying item statistics,
Moving the package into an acceptable structure to handle a large application rather than running out of template.py
Understand how to pull information from osrsDB database and convert that data into something that a machine learning algorithm can understand 

Usage: 
  future usage of this project is hopefully projected at all users that play runescape, using this website as an extra ability to get an idea of what gear should be used at each monster in the game. 
  
License: 
  I am still new and have not went into much understanding of Licenses yet. I do not expect anything in this project to have a large monitary value since it is just based off of a video game with alot of data.
